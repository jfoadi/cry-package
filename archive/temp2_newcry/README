These are the general guidelines for the classes and methods for the package cRy we are trying to develop.

1) Everything related to a class (or to reated classes) will be included in a single module. So, for instance,
we'll have a "angle_S4.R" which includes class "Angle", a "cell_S4.R" which includes both class "UnitCell"
and class "ReciprocalUnitCell", etc.

2) Generic functions that can be applied to methods for several classes will be all written in module "AllGeneric.R".
Other generic functions will be included in individual modules.

3) Each class will include a "validity=function(object)" part where the validity of the object being defined
is tested whenever a "new" function is called. This fuction returns a sentence whenever conditions of validity are
not met. At the very end the function returns TRUE.

4) !!! Warning !!!
After having installed R.15.1 I had the following error message when trying to build cRy:

* checking for file ‘cRy/DESCRIPTION’ ... OK
* preparing ‘cRy’:
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
* checking for LF line-endings in source and make files
* checking for empty or unneeded directories
* looking to see if a ‘data/datalist’ file should be added
Error in if (any(update)) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
Execution halted

After having browsed the internet I found that the issue is related in some misteryous way to the way sysdata.rda is built.
The way round it is to use the different command to build:   

R CMD BUILD --resave-data="best" cRy

which, when executed, gives:

* checking for file ‘cRy/DESCRIPTION’ ... OK
* preparing ‘cRy’:
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
* checking for LF line-endings in source and make files
* checking for empty or unneeded directories
* looking to see if a ‘data/datalist’ file should be added
* re-saving image files
  NB: this package now depends on R (>= 2.10)
* building 'cRy_0.1.tar.gz'

Then, the install R CMD INSTALL cRy_0.1.tar.gz
gives:

* installing to library ‘/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/library’
* installing *source* package ‘cRy’ ...
** R

** preparing package for lazy loading
Creating a generic function for ‘print’ from package ‘base’ in package ‘cRy’

** help

** testing if installed package can be loaded
*** arch - i386
*** arch - x86_64

* DONE (cRy)

The warning is actually not an error. It simply means that until symmetry is not defined, it will not be considered an object of class Symmetry.
I don't know at present how to get round this issue, although it does not bother me too much.
