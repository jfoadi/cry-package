Some lines of all R code in this directory depend on the specific local file structure.
I need to find out how to make them more general, so that when people load this code as
a package, the code will still work.

1) FILE "lattice.R"
   Function "adapt_map" is not finished.

2) FILE "mtz.R"
   "syminfo.lib" file needs to be loaded in a general way.
   "symmetry.R" module needs to be loaded in a general way.

3) FILE "symmetry.R"
   "syminfo.lib" file needs to be loaded in a general way.
   "miscellaneous.R" module needs to be loaded in a general way.

4) FILE "fourier.R"
   "miscellaneous.R" module needs to be loaded in a general way.
